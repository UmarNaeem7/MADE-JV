# Project Plan

## Title
Change in Air Quality Across the Americas & the Primary Contributors

## Main Question
How has air qulaity in the major cities in North & South Americas changed over the past 10 years & what are the primary causes for such changes?

## Description
Air quality degradation is an important problem because it directly affects all the living things including humans, animals & plants. It can lead to health risks, negative environmental impact, economic costs, poor quality of life, etc.

This project analyses the problem by looking at the air quality datasets & emissions datasets & then drawing useful insights & conclusions. The aim would be to find strong correlations between air quality degradations & harmful emissions to determine which emissions have the most negative impact on air quality.

The results can help identifying which areas in the Americas need to pay serious attention to their air quality improvement and as a next step which emissions (causes) they need to lower down.

## Datasources

### Datasource1: WHO Air Quality Database
* Metadata URL: https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/themes/air-pollution/who-air-quality-database
* Data URL: https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/air-pollution-documents/air-quality-and-health/who_aap_2021_v9_11august2022.xlsx?sfvrsn=9035996c_3
* Data Type: Excel file

This data source contains data about air quality measurements in different metrics for all the countries and their major cities. In particlular, this data url is for the year 2022, but there are similar datasets for previous years as well that will be analyzed for the air quality trends.

### Datasource2: EDGAR - Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research
* Metadata URL: https://edgar.jrc.ec.europa.eu/emissions_data_and_maps
* Data URL: https://jeodpp.jrc.ec.europa.eu/ftp/jrc-opendata/EDGAR/datasets/v80_FT2022_GHG/EDGAR_CH4_1970_2022.zip
* Data Type: Excel file (that is zipped)

This data source contains data emissions in all the countries from the years 1970.2022. Emissions can be of several types like greenhouse gases, aerosols, air pollutants, etc. This data url is about the greenhouse emissions but other emissions will also be looked at to find the underlying correlations with air quality.
